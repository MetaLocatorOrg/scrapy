The HP 1620 Switch Series are entry configurable switches for small business networking, a step up from unmanaged devices, with features to enhance network security, performance and reliability.
These Gigabit switches are plug-and-play out of the box, yet network operation can be fine-tuned through features available from a simple web browser-based GUI, if necessary. Enhance security using Virtual LANs, link aggregation or IGMP snooping boost uplink performance and loop prevention enhances network reliability.
The series consists of 8-, 24-, and 48-port 10/100/1000BASE-T models each providing non-blocking Gigabit per port performance. All models can be rack mounted and include the necessary rack mounting hardware; the 8-port model can also be wall mounted. All models come with internal power supplies and localized power cord removing the need to manage external power adapters. The 8-, and 24 port models are fanless for silent operation. All models come with HP Limited Lifetime Warranty.

Parrot Bebop Drone produces the best flight performance ever seen in a leisure drone. The feather-weight ABS reinforced structure makes Parrot Bebop Drone robust and safe. In case of an emergency, the emergency function automatically stops the propellers and lands the drone. EPP hulls are included in the pack and ensure that indoor flights are safer.

To ensure optimal stability without compromising the maneuverability, the Bebop Drone automatically analyses data from numerous 3-axis sensors: accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer. One ultrasound sensor with an 8 meters reach, one pressure sensor and one vertical camera to measure speed.

Equipped with a 14 megapixel ""fisheye"" camera, the Parrot Bebop Drone records videos and takes pictures within a 180° field of view with remarkable image quality. Full-digital image stabilization technology allows the Bebop Drone to take remarkably stable and clear aerial footage regardless of the drones movements, as well as providing a splash and dust proof lens. Action cameras often show distorted horizontal lines. The Parrot Bebop Drone camera provides undistorted lines resulting in a perfect, uncurved horizon.

Thanks to the integrated GPS, control your Bebop drone directly on the map: plan your flights on your smartphone and let your drone do the rest! Accurate GPS localization: around 2 meters with the GNSS chip and tracking with the Glonass satellite. Save over 350 flights and watch them in 3D with the Parrot Cloud thanks to the altitude and speed data collected.
Flight Plan will be available as an in-app FreeFlight Pro purchase.

The Targus 14"" Laptop Privacy Screen is designed to fit 14"" laptops with 16:9 ratio screens. To protect your information, tiny vertical blinds on the surface of the privacy screen narrow the viewing angle so data is only visible directly in front of the monitor up to 45 degrees away from the center of the screen. Onlookers will only see a dark unclear screen when attempting to view the information from a side angle. In addition to providing security, the screen also blocks the glare to help reduce eye strain. The Targus Laptop Privacy Screen can be easily attached by using clear adhesive strips designed for LCD filters or with the included tab guides that stick to the edge of the LCD bezel to hold the screen in place. Users can also position the tabs so the screen easily slides on and off. Highly portable and easy to use, the Targus Privacy Screen prevents onlookers from seeing valuable information often viewed on a laptop or LCD monitor.

The Bose Companion 5 multimedia speaker system is engineered to deliver the excitement of surround sound content right at your computer - without the clutter of five speakers. Just two small speakers and a hideaway Acoustimass module deliver much of the performance you'd expect from a 5.1 system. And a single USB connection is all it takes - no software, hardware or sound card upgrade necessary.
Enjoy an enveloping sound experience without enveloping yourself in hardware. Proprietary TrueSpace surround signal processing enables two desktop speakers and a compact module to put you in the middle of the action. And the experience is developed especially for computer listening.
The Companion 5 system features a all-in-one control pod to keep volume control, one-touch mute, a headphone jack and an auxiliary input within easy reach. The speakers are conveniently mounted on stands.

The Sabrent USB-DH88 USB Display Adapter is the easiest and most effective way to add additional monitors to a PC or Intel-based MAC, desktop or notebook. You can add any LCD, TV, Projector, even old CRTs, via DVI, HDMI, or VGA. After installing the software, simply insert the USB cable into your computer and you can add up to 6 of these units to one computer (One Display Adapter is required for each added Display).
The software is barely noticeable and uses very little computing power to operate. Plus, by using USB 2.0 technology, there is no need to open the computer, or struggle with compatibility issues related to a second VGA card. Simply by adjusting your Display Settings, you can set your monitors to mirror one another or function as one large desktop space, where each monitor can display a different application.

Plug the adapter into the USB Type-C port of your laptop to convert it into four USB-A ports.

The super compact and lightweight hub easily fits into any laptop case, briefcase or backpack making it convenient to take with you on-the-go.
USB Type-C™ is the latest universal standard in connectivity. Compared to earlier generations of USB connectors, USB-C has a slim profile connector to support ultra-thin laptops and tablets. Although USB-C has a low-profile design, it packs a big punch when it comes to speed and power, boasting data transmission speeds of up to 10Gbps* and power transmission of up to 100W. And best of all, it's reversible to allow hassle-free connecting. The new standard fixes the age-old problem of connecting your USB in the wrong way, eliminating the frustration of fumbling with the USB plug when connecting it to a computer.
